# Gloomhaven Printing

I wanted to print a spare gloomhaven item deck, mostly for use with The Crimson Scales, since I was playing both campaigns at the same time.

To generate the pdf for printing you'll need LaTeX and python3 installed.
Just run the `main.py` file and it will create the necessary `.tex` and `.pdf` files.

Printed on 300gsm cardstock on and Epson Expression Photo HD XP-15000, finished with an adhesive spray.
Each front page is paired with a corresponding back page, meant to be printed front then back for each page.
